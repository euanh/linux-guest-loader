There are prerequisites for building a XenServer source release. The build
environment we use is a CentOS-5.7 and we recommend to use the same. All the
following must be installed, either by visiting the project webpage or
installing a pre-built package provided by your OS distributor:

    * GCC
    * GNU Make
    * GNU Binutils
    * RPM build
    * Redhat rpm config (if debuginfo is required)
    * Git
    * Development install of Python (e.g., python-devel)
    * Python setup (e.g., python-setup)

1. Clone the git repository to /some/path/linux-guest-loader
2. cd /some/path/linux-guest-loader and run `make`. This will generate the
    spec file from spec.in and uses the spec file to build the soruce and
    binary rpms.  The source and binary rpms are output to
    /some/path/linux-guest-loader/build/SRPMS/,
    /some/path/linux-guest-loader/build/RPMS/noarch/ respectively.
3. Install the binary rpm into a XenServer using the following.
    `rpm -ivh linux-guest-loader-*.rpm`
